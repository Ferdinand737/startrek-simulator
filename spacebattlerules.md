# Space Battles

## Initiating a Space Battle

You can exhaust a Command to initiate a Space Battle with rival Ships in a single adjacent Sector, or in a single Sector in which you both have Ships.

Each Space Battle consists of a number of Combat Rounds in which both players:

- Roll to score Hits
- Take Casualties
- Decide whether to Retreat or keep fighting

The player who initiates the Space Battle is the Attacker. The player being attacked is the Defender.

## Battle Locations

### Battles Between Sectors

Normally, Space Battles take place between adjacent Sectors. In this case, each player’s Ships remain in their own Sector and fire into the adjacent Sector. Any special rules that apply to any Sector of the Battle apply to the whole Battle.

### Battles in the Same Sector

Space Battles can also take place between rivals in the same Sector. This may occur if:

- A Trade Agreement was broken
- A Cloaking Device was used
- A player built Ships in a System occupied by a rival

In these situations, the Ships involved are fighting within the same Sector.

---

## Attacking from Multiple Sectors

If you have Ships in more than one adjacent Sector, you may use a Command to have all the Ships in those adjacent Sectors join in the attack.

---

## Battles with More Than Two Players

- There will always be one Attacker, but there can be more than one Defender.
- All opponents with Ships in the Sector being attacked are considered Defenders.
- The Attacker divides their attack dice between the Defenders before rolling to Hit.
- All Defenders' Hits are directed at the Attacker.
- Defenders choose whether to Retreat after each Combat Round individually.
- The Battle ends when:
  - All Defenders are eliminated or have retreated
  - The Attacker is eliminated or has retreated

---

## Scoring Hits

- Your current Weapons Level determines your Hit Roll.
- To Score a Hit, roll equal to or higher than your Hit Roll.
- Your opponent’s Shield Modifier is added to your required Hit Roll.

Each player rolls a number of dice equal to the number of Ships they have involved.

### Invulnerable Shields

If your opponent’s Shield Modifier increases your Hit Roll requirement above 6, you cannot score Hits.

If both players are in this situation, the attack cannot succeed and someone must Retreat to end the Battle.

---

## Starbase Support in Space Battles

- Starbases provide support if Ships involved in the Combat are in Orbit of a System you control with a Starbase at that time.
- Roll one additional die to Hit.
- Starbases cannot fight on their own.

### Cardassian: Weaponized Starbases

This Advancement increases the number of additional dice rolled to Hit from 1 to 3.

---

## Rerolls

Certain Advancements and cards allow rerolls of Hits or misses in Space Battles.

- You can only use these if you are the Attacker or a Defender.
- Separate successful and failed dice before rerolling.
- Rerolling successful Hits replaces those dice’s results.
- Rerolling misses gives a second chance to score Hits.
- A die’s new result replaces the original.
- A die can only be rerolled once.

---

## Example: Klingons vs. Romulans

A fleet of 5 Klingon Ships attacks the Romulans.

- Klingons have upgraded Weapons twice and need a 3+ to Hit.
- Romulans have upgraded Shields once (+1 modifier), so Klingons need 4+.
- Klingons roll 5 dice. Rolls of 4, 5, or 6 are Hits.

Romulans have no Weapon upgrades. Klingons have no Shield upgrades.

- Romulans need a 5+ to Hit.
- Both sides roll a number of dice equal to Ships they have in the Combat.

---

## Taking Casualties

- Every Hit destroys an opposing Ship.
- Hits and Casualties are resolved simultaneously.
- The player who scored the Hits decides how to allocate them.

### Example:

You score 4 Hits against an opponent with:

- 5 Ships in a Fleet
- 2 individual Ships

You may allocate all Hits to the Fleet or divide them.

If the rival Fleet is a Klingon Marauder Fleet, it gives the attacker 1 Production per Ship destroyed. This effect happens before the attacker’s own casualties are resolved.

---

## First Strike

Some Advancements give Ships First Strike during the first Combat Round of a battle.

- Opponent must Take Casualties before rolling to Hit.
- Only used in the first Combat Round.
- Does not allow extra attacks — just shifts the order of casualties and Hits.
- If both sides have First Strike, it is canceled.

### Example:

- 6 Romulan Ships with First Strike attack 4 Klingon Marauder Fleet Ships.
- Romulans score 2 Hits and destroy 2 Klingon Ships, disbanding the Fleet.
- Remaining 2 Klingon Ships score a Hit, but since they were no longer part of a Marauder Fleet, no Production is gained.
- In the next Combat Round, all Ships roll and Take Casualties simultaneously.

---

## Retreating from Combat

After taking Casualties, each player assesses the state of their Ships. Starting with the Attacker, they decide to Retreat or not.

- Retreats are made at full Impulse Speed.
- Must be through existing Space Lanes.
- Cannot place new Lanes during Retreat.
- All Ships in the Sector must move as a group.
- Retreat must end in a Sector not adjacent to opponent's Ships.

### Blocked Retreats

- Ships may not Retreat if Space Lanes are blocked by opposing Ships.

---

## Winning a Space Battle

The player who:

- Destroys all opposing Ships, or
- Forces all opposition to Retreat

...wins the Space Battle.

Afterwards, the winner may make a Tactical Maneuver:

- A move up to Impulse Speed
- Cannot place new Space Lanes
- Does not exhaust a Command
- All Ships in a Sector must move and end together

---

## Civilization Specific Abilities

### Andorian: Field Testing

- When the Andorians win a Space Battle, they may claim one destroyed Ship.
- Claimed Ships may be used as Research Tokens in future turns.
- Must be used before actual Research Tokens.
- Cannot claim Borg Cubes.

### Klingon: Ever Victorious

- When the Klingon player wins a Space Battle (or both sides are wiped out), gain **1 Culture** if the opponent fielded 3+ Ships.
- If there are multiple Defenders, and any one who fielded 3+ Ships is destroyed or retreats, the Klingon still gains the Culture.
- If the battle is canceled (e.g., via Romulan Cloaking), no Culture is gained.

### Klingon: Cult of Kahless

- Allows sacrificing Ships to destroy opposing Ships instead of rolling to Hit.
- Prevents rolling to Hit with any of your other Ships for that Combat Round.
- Opponent still rolls to Hit.
- Casualties are removed after all dice rolls.
- The player who inflicted Hits determines allocation, so they won’t normally choose already-destroyed Ships.

### Romulan: Superior Targeting Array

- Allows you to reroll one die in each Combat Round.

---

## Combat Continues

If no one chooses or can Retreat, another Combat Round begins.

- No need to exhaust new Commands
- Continue until a player Retreats or is eliminated
